  <p>
    Further configuration can be done in the <em>application.conf</em> file. The
    <a href="https://github.com/talares/talares/blob/master/src/talares/src/main/resources/reference.conf">default
      configuration</a> shows the configuration options and describes what they are used for.

    For more information on the Typesafe Config library, their <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config">documentation</a>
    can be consulted.

  <p>
    Talares uses <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> for it's core functionality. Akka can also be configured through the
    <em>application.conf</em> file. As Talares uses the logging framework provided by Akka, changing the log level of
    the library is done through the configuration key <strong>akka.loglevel</strong>.

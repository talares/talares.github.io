  <h1>Talares</h1>

  <p>
    Talares is a Scala and Java library that leverages the Tridion OData webservice to make Tridion content available in
    Scala and Java projects.
  </p>

  <p>It's main advantages are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Supplies a non-blocking Scala API and both a non-blocking and a blocking Java API.</li>
    <li>Makes use of an SDL supported product (the Tridion OData webservice).</li>
    <li>Requires minimal configuration.</li>
    <li>Removes the need for packaging a Tridion license within a project freeing said project from machine specific
      configuration and in turn allowing unlimited horizontal scalability.<sup>1</sup>
    </li>
    <li>Multiple cache options leverage your own cache implementation. Auto update cache allows for cached content to be
      updated asynchronously, making sure clients always receive a cached and up to date version of the
      content.<sup>2</sup>
    </li>
    <li>A Scala query DSL allows for extending the core functionality ad-hoc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <sup>1</sup> Horizontal scalability will be limited by the load a single OData webservice will be able to handle and
    the architecture of the adopting project.<br>
    <sup>2</sup> Whether a cached value is up to date depends on the frequency of both the cache being updated and the
    value
    being accessed.
